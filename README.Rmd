**Il cibo climatico** nel seguente progetto procederemo con l'anilisi di dati raccorti sul consumo di carne,
l'inquinamento e la sanitÃ , quanto quel che mangiamo affligge la nostra salute e quella del nostro pianeta? 

**I dataset usati:**

1. "[Meat prices (1990-2020)- Chicken, beef, lamb, pork and salmon prices from 1990 to 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/kianwee/    meat-prices-19902020)", 
2. "[Worldwide consumption of different meats by country from 1991](https://www.kaggle.com/vagifa/meatconsumption)",
3. "[Greenhouse gas emissions](https://github.com/owid/co2-data/blob/master/owid-co2-data.csv)". 

SQL was one of the first commercial languages for Edgar F. Codd's relational model, as described in his influential 1970 paper, "[A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/362384.362685)".

SQL is a declarative language: it allows you to specify *what* to retrieve without saying *how*. When a query is executed by the query processor, it is translated into a procedural language that specifies how to access the data. There are generally more than one possible translations of an SQL query into the procedural language. The task of the query optimizer is to choose the most efficient execution plan.

[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine. SQLite it a good choice for data analysis:

>People who understand SQL can employ the sqlite3 command-line shell (or various third-party SQLite access programs) to analyze large datasets. Raw data can be imported from CSV files, then that data can be sliced and diced to generate a myriad of summary reports. More complex analysis can be done using simple scripts written in Tcl or Python (both of which come with SQLite built-in) or in R or other languages using readily available adaptors. (...) The same thing can be done with an enterprise client/server database, of course. The advantage of SQLite is that it is easier to install and use and the resulting database is a single file that can be written to a USB memory stick or emailed to a colleague.
